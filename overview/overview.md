# OVERVIEW

uPort is an interoperable identity network for a secure, private, decentralized web.

uPort provides open protocols for decentralized identity and interoperable messaging that enable trusted source attribution for all web communication. By allowing message recipients to trust message senders without centralized servers, we can create an entirely new framework for building applications.

uPort returns ownership of identity to individuals. uPort's open identity network allows users to register their own identity on Ethereum independent from any centralized authority. This decentralized model of identity forms the foundation for a user-centric data network, where users own and manage their personal data in privacy. On uPort, users are always in control of their data and they are free to share it with whomever they choose.

uPort provides a standard interface to decentralized identity that bridges networks to create a universal, public-private web-of-trust. uPort identities are simply defined as addresses registered on public, permissionless networks. These addresses are controlled by private keys that sign messages, which can be sent to any destination. Identities are further expressed by a combination of publicly and privately available data. This simple model enables multi-network interoperability and identity standards compliance.

uPort makes it easy to build with decentralized identity on Ethereum. uPort's open source components are simple to use and can support a variety of use case architectures. uPort has been designed to meet demanding usability, flexibility, and interoperability requirements.

uPort decentralizes identity control from centralized custodians and data silos to the edges of the network. In doing so, uPort lays the foundation for a radically free, equitable, p2p, user-centric internet society. Applications, networks, and societies that value decentralization, privacy, or security should consider integrating with the uPort network.
