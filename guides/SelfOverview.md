# Self Overview
## The Self platform**

Self is the most advanced self ID platform. 

Self is a decentralized, self ID platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. By enabling users to manage their identities through the implementation of a. We achieve this by implementing a robust private key management system. 

We believe that identity is everything and we empower people to be their best by making identity free and open. Mission Vision. To understand our benefits there are some terms you must first understand.

## What is Self ID?**

This is where we briefly describe a self-sovereign identity, private keys that are fully controlled by the user.

## The Self network**

This is where we briefly describe the Self network of partners that share data via the user and partner on bringing in the future of user-controlled, self iD.

## What does it enable?**

Self enables you to interact with users' self IDs in many new and interesting ways.

1. Enable users to login to your client-server app with their Self ID
2. Issue signed data to users' Self ID
3. Request data from users' Self ID
4. Request legally-binding signatures from a Self ID
5. Enable users to interact with your Ethereum app

## A Range of Use Cases**

We have integrated Self with a wide range of applications from Ethereum dapps, to nation-state identity systems.

Sample scenarios:

1. Dapp integration use case in a sentence or two
2. Zug use case in a sentence or two (with a link to press or demo)
3. Use case 3 in a sentence or two
4. Use case 4 in a sentence or two

## Introduction to Web 3.0**

If you're still reading, it means you're interested in leaning how Self can improve your application. If you have never interacted with Web 3.0 before, or if you need a quick refreshed, you might want to keep the following in mind:

*Web 3.0 and decentralized applications *require a fundamental rethinking* of the moving parts of the web so it is important to read everything or you may miss some important elements around the design decisions of what you are working with.
