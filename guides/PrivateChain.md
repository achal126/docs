# Private Chain Deployment

The uPort platform supports deployment of our core infrastructure on private Ethereum blockchains.
We're working on a self-serve deployment process, and in the meantime we're happy to help you get set up.
Please take a look at [Olorun] (https://github.com/uport-project/lambda-olorun/blob/master/README.md) to get started.
